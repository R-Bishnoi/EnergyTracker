    "This source code is a Python script that uses the psutil library to measure the power consumption of a single application on a system. The script defines several functions to accomplish this task:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) The get_process_pids() function takes a process name as an input and returns \n",
    "    a list of process IDs that are related to that single application. It does this \n",
    "    by iterating over all running processes on the system and matching the process \n",
    "    name to the input name. If a match is found, the corresponding process ID is appended \n",
    "    to the list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    " (2) The Power_consumption() function takes a list of process IDs as input and calculates the \n",
    "     power consumption of those processes, as well as the total power consumption of all running \n",
    "     processes. It does this by iterating over all running processes and using the psutil library \n",
    "     to access information about the process, including its CPU times. It then calculates the duration \n",
    "     of the process and the energy consumed by the process based on that duration and the process's CPU usage. \n",
    "     The energy consumed by the process is added to the total energy consumed, and if the process ID is in the \n",
    "     input list, it's added to the energy consumed by the single application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " (3) The power_consumption_measurement() function is the main function of the script. It prompts the user to input \n",
    "     the name of a single application and calls the get_process_pids() function to get a list of process IDs related \n",
    "     to that application. It then calls the Power_consumption() function with that list of process IDs to calculate \n",
    "     the power consumption of the single application and the total power consumption. It then calculates the percentage \n",
    "     of power consumed by the single application and prints the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the power_consumption_measurement() function is called to run the script.\n",
